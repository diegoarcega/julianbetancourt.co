One of the beauties of JavaScript is that functions are [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen). This means, functions
are treated as values and hence can be assigned to variables, be returned from functions and even
be used as other function's parameters.

This alone unleashes a set of programming powers that you may have encountered, but are not fully aware of. For instance,
if you are a React developer, you may be used to map through arrays to render something per each item. However,
do you know _why_ you're doing it that way? If you are iterating through the array,
why aren't you using, say `forEach`?.

Before we go any further it is crucial we understand what higher order functions are. Simply put, higher order functions are functions that either:

1. Take another function as a parameter.
1. Return a function
1. Or both

"Why is this important?" You may ask yourself. Well in the first place, JavaScript has some
handy **built-in** higher order functions; yes! you guessed it, `forEach` or `map` are well-known examples
of built-in higher order functions. And just like native utilities, `npm` is full, full of packages that heavily use HOfs so it's useful
to know that somehow your functions are being used by x library. Most importantly, understanding HOFs will
bring many possibilities to your codebase, many tasks may need to be abstracted but also augmented somehow at a latter part of the
program so HOFs can help you with that.

> "I as a function, will receive a function from you, then I will call that function to (maybe) do something internally with it and at end (maybe) give you a new value"

Now that we grasped an idea of what Higuer order functions are and why is it we can use them in JavaScript (because functions are first-class citizens!) let's dissect some of the built-in HOFs of the `Array` global object.

## forEach

`forEach` is basically the functional way to iterate through an array. While in other programming languages you may be forced to use `for` loops
or even recursion exclusively as an iteration method; JavaScript gives us `forEach` as a way to iterate through an array. Let's see a typical implementation of it:

```js
const favoriteBands = [
  "Sum 41",
  "blink-182",
  "A day to remember",
  "Escape the fate",
]

favoriteBands.forEach((band, index) => {
  // will console log each band starting with
  //  0 as index. That is:
  // 'Sum 41' 0
  // 'blink-182' 1
  // etc
  console.log(band, index)
})
```

How would you implement this "by hand"? Well, this one is so easy to understand that we basically saw it in the previous description: you use a `for`. Let's look at it:

```js
function customForEach(fn) {
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    fn(this[i], i)
  }
}

// Do not do this in your app!
Array.prototype.customForEach = customForEach
```

Ok, hold on, something thing to note here. This is kind of a contrived example, in a real scenario you would not
modify `prototype` under any circumstance! See a great explanation [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21788187/javascript-better-way-to-modify-function-prototype).

That being said, let's examine the code!:

The first interesting thing is right in the start. You see that parameter `fn` ? Well, this `customForEach` function _**is**_ a
higher order function, meaning it can accept a function as a parameter; we can't call it `function` as that is a reserved word in the
language but other people may also name it `cb`, `callback` (for async scenarios), `predicate` or simply a description of what the function is, for example a `reducer` ðŸ˜‰.

Now, `this` refers to the array the function is being called with, in our case `favoriteBands`. You see `this` being used
in the `for` loop to know _when_ to stop the loop execution. Just like with `forEach` we need to limit the number of times the loop runs
to the array.length - 1 (that's why we start the index `i` at 0).

Next up, we _call_ the function we're being passed with some data, the current item in the loop execution and the current index; which is exactly what you
use when you use `forEach` right ? `forEach((item, i) => {})`. So when you call `customForEach`

```js
favoriteBands.customForEach((band, index) => {
  console.log(band, index)
})
```

you MUST pass it a function as a parameter, and the function's form is defined by the HOF itself. To be honest, the chances of you
writing your own `forEach` is minimal (if you wanted a different approach you would first reach `lodash`'s [forEach](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#forEach) which actually
beats the native `forEach` performance according to [this benchmark](https://www.measurethat.net/Benchmarks/Show/3470/0/lodash-foreach-vs-native-foreach)).

See how this relates to the statement we discussed before?

1. I as a function (`customForEach`)
1. will receive a function from you `() => {}` (in this case it's an anoymous function but you might as well could have used a named function!)
1. then I will call that function to (maybe) do something internally with it (call it per each array iteration) and at end (maybe) give you a new value (no value returned in our case!)

## map

Let's now look at a more interesting native HOF for arrays: `map`. `Array.prototype.map` lets you
iterate through an array but also apply a function to each item so you can transform them somehow. An important thing is that
`map` will **return** the new transformated array (we will come back to this later).

Let's see how you would use it:

```js
const favoriteBands = [
  { name: "Sum 41", placeOfOrigin: "Ajax, Canada", foundedYear: 1996 },
  { name: "blink-182", placeOfOrigin: "CA, United States", foundedYear: 1992 },
  {
    name: "A day to remember",
    placeOfOrigin: "FL, United States",
    foundedYear: 2003,
  },
  {
    name: "Escape the fate",
    placeOfOrigin: "NV, United States",
    foundedYear: 2004,
  },
]

const favoriteBandsBio = favoriteBands.map(
  (band, index) =>
    `${band.name} was founded in ${band.placeOfOrigin} back in ${band.foundedYear}`
)
```

What would happen then if you wrote `console.log(favoriteBandsBio)` ? What would get printed to the console? It would be

```js
;[
  "Sum 41 was founded in Ajax, Canada back in 1996",
  "blink-182 was founded in CA, United States back in 1992",
  "A day to remember was founded in FL, United States back in 2003",
  "Escape the fate was founded in NV, United States back in 2004",
]
```

Why? Why were we able to to assign `favoriteBands.map` to another variable?. Remember that at the beginning of this section we mentioned something important:
`map` will **return** a new array with the modified items. In our case, we were able to transform each item's content from literal objects
to a simple string by using the object's properties and returning it. (if you are confused because you don't see the `return` word, check [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#function_body)) `.map` does its thing,
its returned value will get assigned to the variable `favoriteBandsBio`.

How would you write your very own `map` then? Let's look at a possible approach:

```js
function customMap(fn) {
  let newArr = []
  this.forEach((item, index) => {
    newArr[index] = fn(item, index)
  })

  return newArr
}

// Do not do this in your app!
Array.prototype.customMap = customMap
```

A few things to discuss here. Notice how we are using `forEach` here instead of the `for` loop we were using for our implementation of `forEach`.
Could we have used a `for` loop ? Yep. But why doing it the imperative way if we can just _declarate_ what we want? After all JS is a functional programming language
and its usage makes perfect sense.

Secondly, notice how we introduced a `newArr` variable. Remember, `map` must return a **new** array, it will not modify the original array whatsoever, so this
`newArr` variable can help us build a new array and return it at the end of the function.

Last, let's check at what we're doing in the iteration of the original array (referenced as `this`). We are doing an assignment operation via
`newArr[index] = `. `forEach`'s `index` will start at `0` so it's a perfect combination to modify the `newArr` (you may also use `newArr.push()` for the same result).
what are we assigning each item to? We are calling the `fn` in the arguments list, that function must **return** something so that we can use it in the `newArr`; very similar
to the `const favoriteBandsBio = favoriteBands.map(` bit we discussed before, we can assign the return value of a function to a variable!

After the `fn` has been called for each item and then pushed to the `newArr` we will be able to return the new value just like with the native `map`!

## reduce

As a final example, let's look at a more challenging task: recreate `Array.prototype.reduce` with our very own code. If you have not heard about `reduce` before this could
blow your mind, it is a particularly hard HOF to understand, and if you use it wisely you can come up with very sophisticated use-cases.

Let's see a graphic example (perhaps the most basic to understand `reduce`), and I will show you the result right away:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

const newNumber = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)

// will be equal to `10`
console.log(newNumber)
```

`reduce` will iterate over an array, and **turn it into a new single value**; this value's type is up to you, it could be a number, literal object,
another array or a string, it is really up to you. The HOF will do so by keeping track of a value for the entirety of the loop and then
modifing that value with the return value of the function you are passing. (I know, thats a lot of "values"!). You see that `0` ? It's an optional
parameter we give to `reduce` so that it can start the value calculation with a given initializer. Here, it will start suming the accumulator `acc` with the current
item in the iteration `curr`, in the first iteration nothing has been `acc`umulated so with that `0`, `reduce` knows how to start the calculation. This is how it will look per
iteration:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>curr</th>
      <th>acc</th>
      <th>operation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1 + 0 = 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2 + 1 = 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>3 + 3 = 6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>4 + 6 = 10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

at the end it will return the last value returned from your operation. We are performing an operation here but we could also modify the accumulator
in each iteration manually and then returning it to the next one. Consider the following:

```js
const testScores = ["A", "A+", "B", "C"]
const students = ["Julian", "Camila", "Bryan", "Leticia"]
const studentScores = testScores.reduce((acc, curr, index) => {
  acc[students[index]] = curr
  return acc
}, {})

// will be equal to
// {Julian: "A", Camila: "A+", Bryan: "B", Leticia: "C"}
console.log(studentScores)
```

See? Contrary to the previous example, here we are getting a brand new object from 2 separate arrays. `testScores` is being
_reduced_ but in each iteration we are making use of an existing variable in the system (`students`). Notice that the starting point is
an empty object literal; this way, in the first loop repetition we have `{}` for `acc`, so we mutate it by doing `acc[students[index]] = curr`
and then pass it to the following iterations. Also note that if we console.logged `testScores` and `students` you would see that they both
are intact. Let's see how we would build such thing ourselves:

For this we need to:

1. Receive a function as a parameter
2. Receive an initializer value as second parameter

```js
function customReduce(fn, init) {}
```

3. Let's remember that the "magic" of `reduce` is simply that it can keep track of a given value during the iterations; that is,
   an iteration `n` is able to know what the previous `acc` was. So for this, it occurs to me that we can create a variable inside the
   function and assign it to that `init` value:

```js
function customReduce(fn, init) {
  let acc = init
}
```

4. Naturally, we have to iterate over the array. Let's use our beloved `forEach` and since we are going to put this in the Array's prototype we
   will access it through `this` **Remember this is merely for explanatory purposes, in your codebase this is not recommended**

```js
function customReduce(fn, init) {
  let acc = init

  this.forEach((item, index) => {})
}
```

5. ok so here comes the fun part, we now need to modify the accumulated value with the returned value of the function we are receiving once it is called, since we are
   mimicking the API of `reduce` we will pass the arguments `(acc, curr, index)` in that order

```js
function customReduce(fn, init) {
  let acc = init

  this.forEach((item, index) => {
    acc = fn(acc, item, index)
  })
}
```

6. Finally, after the loop is done, we just return the last `acc`umulated value and voilÃ ! We have our very own reduce!

```js
function customReduce(fn, init) {
  let acc = init

  this.forEach((item, index) => {
    acc = fn(acc, item, index)
  })

  return acc
}

// Do not do this in your app!
Array.prototype.customReduce = customReduce
```

And there we have it! As you can see, building your own HOFs is not that hard! You just receive functions, use them somehow
and **perhaps** return a new value. You remember how in the beginning of the article we mentioned how this would help us understand
why react developers _love_ to `map` over arrays and convert them into UI items? Why don't they use `forEach` if all they are doing
is iterating over an array! Well, if you've paid close attention, you will have noticed that `forEach` (just like our custom
implementation) DOES NOT RETURN ANYTHING! so if you did this:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    {favoriteBands.forEach(band => <div key={band.id}>{band.name}</div>))}
  </div>
)

```

then the expression between those `{}` will be nothing (aka `undefined`!) so after the iteration is done React will simply be unable to
paint anything on the screen because...`undefined` is no JSX, is it? The following on the other hand _will_ return a set of JSX
for each item!

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    {favoriteBands.map(band => <div key={band.id}>{band.name}</div>))}
  </div>
)

```

That is all ðŸ˜€ I hope you grasped a better idea of what HOFs are, that you realize you've been using them perhaps even without being aware and how you can
write your very own in your next task!
